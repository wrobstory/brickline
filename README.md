# brickline

Brickline is a set of command line utilities for manipulating, modifying, and analyzing BrickLink LEGO wanted lists. 

This README contains information on how to
[install `brickline`](https://github.com/wrobstory/brickline#installation) as well as a guide to the available commands. 

## Commands

### Join

Join two Bricklink Wanted List on ItemID and Color, summing the minimum quantity (MinQty) values of the two lists; it will keep the remaining metadata from the lefthand list. This is something you can't do on Bricklink right now: if you try to copy a wanted list to another wanted list with duplicate ItemID/Color combinations you will get a "Warning: Item color combination already exists".

Example: 
```
$ ./target/release/brickline join -l ./resources/test/test_wanted_list_3.xml \
                                  -r ./resources/test/test_wanted_list_4.xml \
                                  -o /tmp/joined_wanted_list.xml
Left Bricklink Wanted List: ./resources/test/test_wanted_list_3.xml
Right Bricklink Wanted List: ./resources/test/test_wanted_list_4.xml
Merging wanted lists...
Writing joined wanted list to /tmp/joined_wanted_list.xml
```
